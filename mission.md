>Give me an army saying the rosary and I will conquer the world
>-Pope Pius IX

We will be frank, Evil is present in the world. It’s not something we should shy away from. This world has skeletons, and they should not be stashed in the back of the closet to rattle their bones unattended.

We at The Forge  truly believe that each and every one of us has a calling(some big, and some small) to fight this evil through the power of prayer, and luckily for us God does not want us rushing into battle unarmed. He’s given us tools– weapons– to use against the forces of the devil, one of the strongest being The Rosary.

So many graces are brought on to those who pray with The Blessed Mother, through the power of the lord. As Pope Pius IX alludes to, mountains can literally be moved through careful and deliberate meditation on the twenty sacred mysteries.

With that in mind, for as long as God wishes, with what ever time He has given us, The Forge has taken up the task of arming as many people as possible with a rosary–a sword– to take into prayer.
