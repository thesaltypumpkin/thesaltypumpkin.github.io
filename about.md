I am currently a junior at the University of Mary Washington with a double major in English and Computer Science. 
    While both are things that I enjoy, neither one is the thing that I love. 

My real, for lack of a better word, passion is making rosaries. Truth be told, my future isn't in computer science. It's not in English. After I graduate I am applying to Focus. It's an organization with missionaries all across the United States on College campuses. 

Long story made short, depression almost killed me several years ago. A focus missionary, Nick Grevas, reached out to me and brought me back into the Chuch. Up until I met him I had on been self destructing, I had been hurting myself, I had been hurting others, I was angry, and lost. Nick pulled me back in. Nick put me on the path of letting God forgive me, and I have been unapolagetically catholic ever since. 

So I don't want a job in software develpoment. And that might seem counter intuative, seeing as my entire college career so far has set me up for that. I want a job in being there for people, who were lost like me. I want a job in loving people, and giving people a hand in encountering God and reencountering god, and remembering that they are loved. Just like every single missionary I have met, in focus, has reminded me that I am loved.

Extending that, I don't want a career in computer science. Thing is I make rosaries. That is where my life is right now. Everything that I do, everything that I learn, is applied to that. I don't know much, I'm not an expert on vocation or callings or anything like that. But I know with about 83% certainty that God wants me making rosaries. 

Every computer science skill that I pick up, that goes into how to further my ministry. That is why I am still in this major. This blog, takes you through one practical thing that I have learned, and how I plan to use it to further my ministry. 


I am literally Building the Forge. That is my career. This is the story of how I am building The Forge. Right now you see how I am developing a webapp to help with my record keeping. In the future you'll see more of my story. So stay tuned, stay holy, and always pray.
